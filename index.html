      <p>Three Intensive SAT Workshop sessions for high school students will be offered this summer that prepare students for the October PSAT and the NEW SAT. In these sessions, students will grow tremendously in their confidence as they master the skills needed to excel in Math, Writing and Language, and Reading. The NEW SAT is comprised of a 100-minute Evidenced-Based Reading and Writing Section that contains a 65-minute Reading Test comprised of passages from literature, history, social studies, and science and a 35-minute Writing and Language Test. The NEW SAT contains an 80-minute Math Section comprised of a 55-minute Calculator-based test and a 25-minute Non-calculator based test. The NEW SAT also contains a 50-minute Optional Essay. Students receive a score between 200 and 800 for Evidenced Based Reading and Writing and a score between 200 and 800 for Math. There are 1600 points possible on the New SAT. Students also receive subscores and cross-test scores demonstrating skills in more specific areas.</p>

        <p>Students learn the strategies, techniques, and tricks that are necessary on both the Calculator-based and the Non-calculator based sections in order to finish each section successfully in the allotted time.  Practice makes perfect, and it is so true on the NEW SAT MATH. Students learn to approach SAT math sections with confidence.  In addition to extensive practice and drills, students will also complete both calculator-based and non-calculator based timed SAT Math sections throughout the course. Because each class covers new math content and builds on the skills and concepts covered in the previous classes, it is important that students attend all five classes of the Math Workshop.</p>

        <p>In this Intensive Writing Workshop, students master the "Must Know" rules of grammar that are tested on the Language and Writing section of the SAT. Students learn to revise and edit text from a range of content areas, and decide whether passages can be improved by making changes to words, punctuation, or sentence order. Students learn to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, and punctuation.  Students also learn to improve the development and organization of a passage and to quickly recognize grammatically correct sentences.  Students work from customized materials to master the skills needed to achieve great scores.  In addition to the consistent language and writing drills in the class, students complete timed Writing sections throughout the course.
