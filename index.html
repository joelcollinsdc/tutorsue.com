        <p>Seven Intensive SAT Workshop sessions for high school students will be offered this summer that prepare
          students for
          the PSAT and the SAT. In these sessions, students will grow tremendously in their confidence as they master
          the skills needed to excel in Math, Writing and Language, and Reading. The SAT is comprised of a 100-minute
          Evidenced-Based Reading and Writing Section that contains a 65-minute Reading Test comprised of passages from
          literature,
          history, social studies, and science and a 35-minute Writing and Language Test. The SAT contains an 80-minute
          Math Section comprised of a 55-minute calculator-based test and a 25-minute non-calculator-based test.
          Students receive a score between 200 and 800 for Evidenced Based Reading and Writing and a score between 200
          and 800 for Math. There are 1600 points possible on the SAT.

            Additional Topics</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Students learn the strategies, techniques, and tricks that are necessary on both the calculator-based and the
        non-calculator-based
        sections in order to finish each section successfully in the allotted time. Practice makes perfect, and it
        is so true on SAT MATH. Students learn to approach SAT math sections with confidence. In addition to extensive
        practice and drills, students will also complete both calculator-based and non-calculator-based timed SAT Math
        sections
        throughout the course. Because each class covers new math content and builds on the skills and concepts covered
        in
        the previous classes, it is important that students attend all five classes of the Math Workshop.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>(Closed - Waitlist Only) Session I:</em> June 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24</li>
        <li>

      <p>
      <div class="session-time">Time: 6 â€“ 9 pm</div>
      </p>
      <p>In this Intensive Writing Workshop, students master the "Must Know" rules of grammar that are tested on the
        Language
        and Writing section of the SAT. Students learn to revise and edit text from a range of content areas and decide
        whether passages can be improved by making changes to words, punctuation, or sentence order. Students learn to
        correct
        errors in sentence structure, usage, and punctuation. Students also learn to improve the development and
        organization
        of a passage and to quickly recognize grammatically correct sentences. Students work from customized materials
        to
        master the skills needed to achieve great scores. In addition to the consistent language and writing drills in
        the
        class, students complete timed Writing sections throughout the course. Because each class covers new content and
        builds on the skills and concepts covered in the previous classes, it is important that students attend all five
        classes of the Writing and Language Workshop.

      <p>In this Intensive Reading Workshop, students take control of reading passages by learning and then practicing
        the strategies that are necessary to select the correct answers. Â The SAT is a test of advanced reading
        comprehension,
        and students must learn the strategies necessary to analyze passages from classic and contemporary literature,
        history,
        social studies, and science. The strategies taught in these sessions will help students to identify correct
        answer choices
        and to gain confidence in their reading skills. Students learn what to look for in a passage, how to become
        active readers,
        how to better understand the passages, and how to approach evidence-based questions. Students learn to examine
        how the author
        persuades the reader and to compare the opinions discussed in the passage. In addition to practicing individual
        passages
        from literature, history, social studies, and science, students will gain exposure to the full 65-minute Reading
        section
        throughout the workshop. Because each class covers new content and builds on the skills and concepts covered in
        the previous
        classes, it is important that students attend all five classes of the Reading Workshop.</p>
